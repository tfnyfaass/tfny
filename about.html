                        <h3>Nice to meet you.</h3>
                        <p class="welcome">Welcome to my world, where psychology meets design and creativity sparks innovation.</p>
                        <p>My journey began with a fascination for endocrinology and behavior in school, leading me down the rabbit hole of user experience and design. With a Google UX Design Certificate, the pursuit of a full-stack developer certificate from Codecademy, and a deep-seated passion for bringing ideas to life, I've found my niche in this vast, dynamic field of UX design.</p>
                        <p>From my enriching experiences working at the Faculty of Medicine at UBC, UBC HR, to startups, I've reveled in the art of merging aesthetic design with practical functionality through instructional design, UX/UI design, graphic design, and web development.</p>

                        <h5>Designing with heart and mind</h5>
                        <p>Balance is key – not just in my everyday life but also in my work, where I focus on creating user-centered solutions. Solutions that are not only aesthetic or visually pleasing, but also functional and resonate on a human level, are essential to crafting experiences that are thoughtful, inclusive, and impactful. </p>

                        <h5>Stay curious, keep growing</h5>
                        <p>"Wonder is the beginning of wisdom" – Every question for me is a doorway to new knowledge, and each problem is an opportunity for growth. I'm constantly on a journey of exploration, user research, question-pondering, existence-questioning, and seeking solutions that simplify the complex and transform the ordinary into the extraordinary.</p>

                        <h5>In someone else's shoes</h5>
                        <p>Perspective-taking, for me, goes beyond skill – it's a guiding principle. I embrace empathy to understand others' viewpoints, a philosophy that is rooted in me since my multi-cultural childhood and one that drives my work now. This approach allows me to effectively identify user pain points and create solutions that balance user needs with business objectives.</p>

                        <p>With Cambodia and Thailand ranking high on my list of memorable adventures, travelling is a strong passion of mine. I love to bring my film or digital cameras with me to capture precious moments, or attend a concert in Seoul.</p>
